This project is a VR game called Smash The City, which my buddy Stormyman and I made for our CS 6334 Virtual Reality class as our semester project in Fall of 2021.

In this game, the player controls a mech, either with a mouse and keyboard or a VR headset plus controllers. Your goal is to kill all enemies in a city, all of which are monsters. Additionally, all the buildings in the city are fully destructible.

There is a huge emphasis on destructability as a gameplay element in this game.
